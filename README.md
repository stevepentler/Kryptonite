### Pitch
Pomodoros have been a hot trend in programming recently, a concept that encourages taking 5 minute breaks for every 25-30 minutes worked. This concept is solid - maxmize the productivity, while building in breaks for fresh outlooks on those hard to solve problems. Unfortunately, most people are easily capable of working through the buzzer on most pomodor apps.

### Solution
Upon triggering a pomodoro, a window emerges and the user is not able to access their controls for the duration of the pomodoro. 

## Skills Utilized:
React, Electron, JavaScript

## Using the App

##### Setting Intervals
- Fill out the form upon launch
 - Work interval is the amount of time before you take a break
 - Break interval is the amount of time you'd like to take a break
 - Click "Start Timer"

##### Running in the Background
- This app is able to run in the background.
 - click the "Kr" icon on the top right to show or hide the application

##### Opting Out
- During work mode you can click "stop" to see the main screen
- During break time, **you must enter the response verbatum to exit a break.**
 - These are purposefully complicated and long, and you will not have access to the internet
 - Here's an example, but you probably won't have the luxury of having this quote on your clip board. Oh, and the quote changes every break.
