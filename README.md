### Pitch
A pomodoro work schedule encourages taking 5 minute breaks for every 25-30 minutes worked. This concept is solid - maximize productivity, while building in breaks for fresh outlooks on those hard to solve problems. Unfortunately, most people are easily capable of working through the buzzer on most pomodoro apps.

### Solution
Upon triggering a pomodoro, a window emerges and the user is not able to access their controls (click, ⌘ + Tab, or swipe panes) for the duration of the pomodoro. 

## Skills Utilized:
React, Electron, JavaScript

## Using the App

##### Setting Intervals
- Fill out the form upon launch
 - Work interval is the amount of time before you take a break
 - Break interval is the amount of time you'd like to take a break
 - Click "Start Timer"

##### Running in the Background
- This app is able to run in the background.
 - click the "Kr" icon on the top right to show or hide the application

##### Opting Out
- During work mode you can click "stop" to see the main screen
- During break time, **you must enter the response verbatum to exit a break.**
 - These are purposefully complicated and long, and you will not have access to the internet
 - Here's an example, but you probably won't have the luxury of having this quote on your clip board. Oh, and the quote changes every break.
